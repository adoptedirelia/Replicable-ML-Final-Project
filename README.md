# Replicable-ML-Final-Project  
Implement a *replicable* version of decision tree model.

## Task
Build a Classification Decision Tree to determine if a loan will be approved or not based on features such as age, gender, occupation, education level, marital status, income, and credit score.

## Dataset
We use the simple loan dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/simple-loan-classification-dataset/ 

## Roadmap
S1: 

## Code Structure  
`./dataset/`: directory for datasets.
`./tutorial/`: directory for decision tree model tutorial.
`ClassicDT.py`: implements a pipeline to use decision tree model from sklearn.
`config.py`: defines the global variable for the repository.
